# Rubik-s-Cube-Probability-Distribution
Research Project Exploring how Rubik's Cube Solve Times are Distributed

This is a project from high school in which I investigate how to model Rubik's Cube Probability Distributions, using database manipulation through a combination of RStudio and Microsoft Excel. Additionally I used statistical methods involving Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and Hypothesis Testing to fit and measure the effectiveness of different probability models.
